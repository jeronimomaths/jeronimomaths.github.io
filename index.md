I am a Postdoctoral research associate at the Mathematical Institute at the University of Oxford, working in [Ric Wade](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/wade/index.html#)'s team.

In September 2024, I completed my PhD at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany under the supervision of [Claudio Llosa Isenrich](https://www.math.kit.edu/user/llosa/index.html). In 2020 I completed my Master's at the University of Bonn under the supervision of [Ursula Hamenstädt](https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/ursula/). Before that I obtained my Bachelor's at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM).

My research lies at the intersection of group theory, geometric topology, and metric geometry, placing it within the area of geometric group theory. I am particularly interested in the large scale geometry of infinite groups and spaces, especially through invariants such as quasi-isometry invariants. This is in part motivated by the conjectural quasi-isometry classification of nilpotent groups.

Much of my work has focused on the study of filling functions of groups and space, such as the Dehn function, a fundamental quasi-isometry invariant of groups. More recently, I have been interested in studying automorphism groups of non-positively curved groups, including right-angled Artin groups.
