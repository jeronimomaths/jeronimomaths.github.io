- You can download <a href="/cohomology.py">here</a> the _SageMath_ code used to compute the Betti numbers of the Lie algebra cohomology with trivial coefficients of certain central products in [_On the Dehn functions of central products of nilpotent groups_][CentralDehn]  with [Gabriel Pallier](https://pallier.org/gabriel/) and [Claudio Llosa Isenrich](https://www.math.kit.edu/user/llosa/index.html).

- Some [advice](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/agelos_georgakopoulos/writingmathadvise.pdf) on writing paper by [Agelos Georgakopoulos](https://agelos.neocities.org).
