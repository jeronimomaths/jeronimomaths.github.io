- You can download <a href="assets/cohomology.py">here</a> the _SageMath_ code used to compute the Betti numbers of the Lie algebra cohomology with trivial coefficients of certain central products in [_On the Dehn functions of central products of nilpotent groups_][CentralDehn]  with [Gabriel Pallier](https://pallier.org/gabriel/) and [Claudio Llosa Isenrich](https://www.math.kit.edu/user/llosa/index.html).

- A piece of <a href="assets/writingmathadvise.pdf">advice</a> on writing papers by [Agelos Georgakopoulos](https://agelos.neocities.org) which I find useful.
